Keras is a high-level deep learning API written in Python that allows for easy construction and training of neural networks. It is built on top of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow. Here are the primary methods in Keras and their purposes:

1. Model Building Methods
Sequential API
Sequential(): Used to create a linear stack of layers.
from keras.models import Sequential
model = Sequential()
Functional API
Input(): Defines the input layer.
Model(): Used to create a model by specifying inputs and outputs.



2. Layer Methods
Dense(): Fully connected layer.
Conv2D(): 2D convolutional layer.
MaxPooling2D(): Max pooling operation for 2D spatial data.
Flatten(): Flattens the input.
Dropout(): Applies dropout to prevent overfitting.
LSTM(): Long Short-Term Memory layer for sequential data.



3. Model Compilation and Training
compile(): Configures the model for training by specifying loss, optimizer, and metrics.

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
fit(): Trains the model on the given data.

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
fit_generator(): Trains the model using data generated in batches (used for data augmentation).

evaluate(): Evaluates the model performance on test data.

model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
predict(): Generates predictions for input data.

predictions = model.predict(x_new)




4. Saving and Loading Models
save(): Saves the entire model to a file.

model.save('model.h5')
load_model(): Loads a saved Keras model.

from keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('model.h5')




5. Callbacks
EarlyStopping(): Stops training when a monitored metric stops improving.
ModelCheckpoint(): Saves the model during training.
TensorBoard(): Enables TensorBoard logging.




6. Data Preprocessing
ImageDataGenerator(): Augments image data for training.

from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, rotation_range=20)
Tokenizer(): Tokenizes text for NLP tasks.

pad_sequences(): Pads sequences to the same length.




7. Utility Functions
get_weights(): Retrieves the weights of a layer.

set_weights(): Sets the weights of a layer.

summary(): Prints a summary of the model.

model.summary()
plot_model(): Plots the model architecture.
